# Step 1: Set up communication among team/mentor

To ensure that you earn the 1000 project points with a minimum of stress, 
the most important thing you need to do FIRST today in lab is make sure that you know 
how to communicate, frequently, over the next 7 days with:
* Your mentor
* Your fellow team members
* The TA assigned to your team

Earning points happens by this process:
1. An issue is created on the project page for your team.  It may be created by you, by a mentor,
   by a TA, or by the instructor.
2. BEFORE you start working on the issue, get the issue "approved" by a mentor, TA or instructor,
   and get a point estimate.  Point estimates should be 100, 200 or 400. (Guidelines for point
   estimation appear below.)

# Guidelines for point estimation

* 100: Straightforward change; just follow the example. It's clear what to do and how to do it.
* 200: Involves a bit of work, and a bit of figuring things out, but if you work at it a bit, it
   all falls into place.   The process has been outlined pretty clearly, and we've gone over it.
* 400: Involves more than just applying concepts from a tutorial that we've gone over in class.
   Either:
   * It involves applying concepts from a tutorial we have *not* gone over
   * It involves indepdendent research (e.g. google searches, StackOverflow, etc.) to
      figure out how to solve the problem.
   * You can see that there are some "known unknowns" and possibly some "unknown unknowns"
      that will have to be addressed.

Note that these are *initial estimates*.  After the fact, you can present a case why a point
value should be increased.   The case involves explaining the good faith effort you made to
solve the problem, and why it was more complex than the initial estimate might have indicated.

It does NOT involve conversations such as "we started the night before it was due" or 
"my cat ran over my dog, and then my hamster threw up on my computer, and then I broke my leg".
