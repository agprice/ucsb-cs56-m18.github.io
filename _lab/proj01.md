# Step 1: Set up communication among team/mentor

To ensure that you earn the 1000 project points with a minimum of stress, 
the most important thing you need to do FIRST today in lab is make sure that you know 
how to communicate, frequently, over the next 7 days with:
* Your mentor
* Your fellow team members
* The TA assigned to your team

# Understand the process

You need to earn 1000 points by next Tuesday.

You may earn up to 1100 points; the extra 100 count as up to 2% extra credit on your final
course grade.  (Points earned beyond 1100 contribute to your learning, but not to your grade.)

## Process in Brief

First the process in brief, then a detailed description of each step.
1. **Issue is created** in Github (by anyone) and placed in "To-Do" column of your Project on github.
2. **Issue is approved and points are estimated** by Mentor, TA or Instructor. 
   As part of this **define clearly what "done" means**.
3. **Issue is assigned** to one or more team members and placed in "In-Progress" column.
4. You **actually work** on the issue.
4. **Issue is completed** and a **Pull Request** is entered. At this point, issue moves to the
   "Needs Review" column.
5. **Pull Request is peer-reviewed** by mentor.  
6. **Feedback is placed in the (private) feedback repo** for
   the team that worked on the issue.
7. **TA or Instructor** assigns a grade (recorded in the feedback repo).
8. **Points are recorded on Gauchospace**

## Process in Detail

1. **Issue is created** in Github (by anyone) and placed in "To-Do" column of your Project on github.

   The issue is created on the issues list for your team, i.e. here:
   
   <div class="project-links" markdown="1">
   <style>
     div.project-links table * th  { font-weight: bold; text-align:center; padding: 5px; }
     div.project-links table * td  { font-weight: bold; text-align:center; padding: 5px; }
   </style>

   </div>
   
   Then it is placed in the TO-DO column of the project page for your team, here:

2. BEFORE you start working on the issue, get the issue "approved" by a mentor, TA or instructor,
   and get a point estimate.  This happens by having either a mentor, TA, or instructor
   make a comment of the form: `Approved, Estimate 200 points` on the issue, on Github.
   
   Point estimates should be 100, 200 or 400. (Guidelines for point
   estimation appear below.)   If you start working on the issue before it is approved and estimated,
   you do so at your own risk.  
   
   It is very important that the mentor be sure there is a clear **definition of "done"**.
   Try to make sure that what "done" looks like is as clearly spelled out as possible.
   If the issue is too vague, it will difficult to estimate, and even *harder* to determine
   later whether students have earned the points.  This is a very important step! 
   Discuss the *definition of "done"* with the team.
   
   <p> <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">So it is important that you work FIRST today
   on making sure that your team has enough issues in the TODO pile that you can work towards and
   earn 1000 points by next Friday at 9:30am.</span>.   Work FIRST today on identifying issues
   and getting them estimated.  If you need to, you can stay 
   after the 9:30am lab (the 9:30am mentors will stay around until 12:30), and you can also stay 
   after the 11am lab (I'll be around, as will Derek from 12:30-2:30, and Zihao from 2:30-4:30).
   
   The github ids of the folks that can approve issues are here.  
   **You can contact any/all of these folks via Instructor Notes on Piazza**.

3. **Issue is assigned** to one or more team members and placed in "In-Progress" column.

   You (or your mentor) will drag the issue from the "To-do" column into the "In-Progress"
   column on your project page, here.  Also, you or your mentor can assign people to the 
   issue on github.  This helps us track who is working on what, and simplifies the process
   later of who gets credit.  (Note that you can make adjustments to that in the pull request
   if who worked on something and who should get credit changes.)
   
   Also **discuss the definition of "done"** with the folks to whom the issue is assigned.
   
   <div class="project-links" markdown="1">

   </div>

4. This is the stage where you actually work on the issue.  Get it to the "done" criteria.
   
   
4. **Issue is completed** and a **Pull Request** is entered. 
   At this point, issue moves to the
   "Needs Review" column.
   
   After creating the pull request, add a comment that references the issue
   that it addresses.  If you use the syntax `#` followed by an issue number, 
   e.g. `fixes #4`, then the `#4` becomes a hyperlink to the issue.  This is very
   helpful.
   
   Then, notify your mentor that the issue is done, and ask them to review it.
   
5. **Pull Request is peer-reviewed** by mentor.  

   MENTORS: More detail about peer-reviewing issues will be posted here later.
   It will be similar to this process from past instances of CS56: (TODO)
   
6. **Feedback is placed in the (private) feedback repo** for
   the team that worked on the issue.
   
    MENTORS: More detail about peer-reviewing issues will be posted here later.

7. **TA or Instructor** assigns a grade (recorded in the feedback repo).

   TAs: More detail about peer-reviewing issues will be posted here later.
   It will be similar to this process from past instances of CS56:  (TODO)
   
8. **Points are recorded on Gauchospace**

# Guidelines for point estimation

* 100: Straightforward change; just follow the example. It's clear what to do and how to do it.
* 200: Involves a bit of work, and a bit of figuring things out, but if you work at it a bit, it
   all falls into place.   The process has been outlined pretty clearly, and we've gone over it.
* 400: Involves more than just applying concepts from a tutorial that we've gone over in class.
   Either:
   * It involves applying concepts from a tutorial we have *not* gone over
   * It involves indepdendent research (e.g. google searches, StackOverflow, etc.) to
      figure out how to solve the problem.
   * You can see that there are some "known unknowns" and possibly some "unknown unknowns"
      that will have to be addressed.

Note that these are *initial estimates*.  After the fact, you can present a case why a point
value should be increased.   The case involves explaining the good faith effort you made to
solve the problem, and why it was more complex than the initial estimate might have indicated.

It does NOT involve conversations such as "we started the night before it was due" or 
"my cat ran over my dog, and then my hamster threw up on my computer, and then I broke my leg".
