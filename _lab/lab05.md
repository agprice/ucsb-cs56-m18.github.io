What you need to do today in lab:

<ol>
<li> Fill out your name on this worksheet at the top</li>
<li> (10 pts) Fill in your mentor's name and team name below:

<style>
div.fill-in-table table {
  border:1px solid black;
  width: 90%;
  text-align:center;
}
</style>

<div class="fill-in-table" markdown="1">
  
| Mentor | Team |
|-|-|
| | |

</div>
</li>

<li markdown="1"> Locate your feedback repo by visiting http://github.org/ucsb-cs56-m18 and searching for FEEDBACK.
  If you don't have access to it, ask your mentor for help.
  
* Read through it.  
* You should see  feedback from your mentor, detailing the pull requests and issues for which your team is supposed to get credit.
* Make sure you understand everything that is there, and that the list is a COMPLETE list of everything for which you are expecting to get credit.  
* Make sure the final understanding is RECORDED IN THE FEEDBACK REPO, not just a verbal agreement.
* When you've done that, get your mentor to initial here: <code>____</code> and you initial here: <code>____</code>  and record the date/time here: <code>____</code>  to indicate that the feedback repo, at that time, is complete and that you accept what is there.
* If there is any dispute about that, bring it to the instructor's attention NOW before this lab is done.
  </li> 
  
  <li markdown="1"> Now look in the repo and see if your TA (Mahnaz for front two rows, Santha for back two rows) has:
  
  * assigned the final points (i.e. grade our of /1000 plus extra credit out of /100) for your team based on the issues you completed, and the feedback from your mentor, and
  * has recording that feedback IN THE FEEDBACK REPO (not just told you).
  * When that's done, you initial <code>____</code>  and your TA initials here:<code>____</code> and record date/time <code>____</code>.
* If there is any dispute about that, bring it to the instructor's attention NOW before this lab is done.

THEN TURN OVER THE PAGE FOR THE FINAL 50 points.

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

</li>
 
<li markdown="1"> (50 pts) Now, rows 1 and 2 and rows 3 and 4 are going to trade repos, and check that they can COMPILE AND RUN each others final projects.    
  
* Send the row in front or behind you the URL of the repo from which you did your last pull request.  Write that url here:   
   * <code>_________________________________________</code>
* Get the corresponding URL of the row behind you.  Write that url here:   
   * <code>_________________________________________</code>
* In pairs, individually, or as a team, try to compile and run their code.  IF THERE IS ANY DATABASE SET UP NEEDED, the README of both your repo and that of the other team should document that setup.  IF IT DOESN'T, GET SOMEONE FROM EACH TIME TO STOP AND FIX THIS.

Were you able to get the other team's repo to run? Circle one:  YES NO

Where they able to get your repo to run? Circle one:  YES NO

Explain any NO answers.   The goal is to NOT HAVE a NO answer.

</li>
</ol>
