<li>  A satisfied user of a web app, invests their time, energy, and attention <b>in exchange for a reward</b>. 

<ol> 
  
  <li> (20 pts) For the webapp your team is building: <b>what is this reward?</b>  </li>

  <li> (20 pts) Why is that reward important to the user of your app?  </li>

  <li> (20 pts) How do you know when the user has gotten that reward?    That is, what could we observe or measure
to know that your web app was succesful? 

Note: We're looking for something other than directly asking the user "did you like this web app" or "did this web app meet your needs".  Instead, think about whether we could tell whether the users needs were met by observing something about their usage of the app itself.
