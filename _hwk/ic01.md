<li>  A satisfied user of a web app, invests their time, energy, and attention <b>in exchange for a reward</b>. 

<ol> 
  
  <li> (20 pts) For the webapp your team is building: <b>what is this reward?</b>  </li>

  <li> (20 pts) Why is that reward important to the user of your app?  </li>

  <li markdown="1"> (20 pts) <b>How do you know</b> when the user has gotten that reward?    
  
  That is, what could we observe or measure to know that your web app was successful in giving the user their reward? 

Note: Asking the user "did you like this web app?" or "did this web app meet your needs?" could be valuable, but <i>that's not what this question is asking about</i>.

<i>Instead</i>, think about what we could <b>directly observe</b> about the user's interactions with the web app that could help us determine if/when the user has gotten the reward.
