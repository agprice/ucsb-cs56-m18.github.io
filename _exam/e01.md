## Coverage

TBD, but for now:

**Homework:**

* [H00](/hwk/h00), [H01](/hwk/h01), [H02](/hwk/h02), [H03](/hwk/h03), [H04](/hwk/h04), [H05](/hwk/h05), [H06](/hwk/h06)
* Reading that was covered in those homework assignments
* [lab00](/lab/lab00), [lab01](/lab/lab01),[lab02](/lab/lab02),[lab03](/lab/lab03)
* Lectures through Wednesday 08/29/2018.

**A few selected topics:** (not an exclusive list, but some things from the homework, in-class work, reaading, labs, lectures, above that I may highlight:

* the distinction between primitive values, references, and the objects to which references refer
* == vs. .equals.  Review this web page: [topics/java_double_equals_vs_dot_equals/](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/java_double_equals_vs_dot_equals/)
* how compiling and executing with bytecodes and the Java Virtual Machine differs from compiling and executing when working with C/C++
* working with ArrayList<E> (as in [lab02](/lab/lab02))
     * the distinction between implementing a class that inherits from `ArrayList<E>` (is-a) vs. one that has a private data member of type `ArrayList<E>` (has-a).    With is-a, you work with the `this` object.  With has-as, there is a data member you work with.  Understand what that means in terms of code.
* The most basic git workflows:
    * what does `git clone url` do when the url is a repo on github.com? (In your answer, address the relationship created
       between the *two* repos that are involved in this operation.) 
    * `git add filename(s)`, `git commit -m 'message', `git push origin master`
    * what is the command to show the current situation with the repo represented by the current directory (A: `git status`)
    * what changes a regular directory tree into a git repo? (A: presence of the `.git` subdirectory at the top level)
* At a high level, some basic facts about Ant and Maven (factored out into a list below)

# Ant vs. Maven for this exam

What they share in common: 
* The fact that they are both addressing the same problem that `make` and `Makefiles` address for C++, i.e. managing the compile, build, test and execution steps for a project.
* Ant and Maven both use XML files to specify the project details


   
   
* XML also uses self-closing tags when there is no content (e.g. `<foo>`) and close tags (`</foo>`)


Some things that distinguish Ant from Maven:
* Ant uses `build.xml` by default, Maven uses `pom.xml` by  default.
* Ant only addresses the problems addressed by `make` and `Makefile`; Maven also addresses the problem of automatically downloading dependencies (including transitive dependencies; if you depend on A, and A depends on B,C,D, Maven will figure that out and download B,C,D for you.)
* With Ant, while there are some common conventions, ultimately the directory structure is up to the programmer; Maven requires a particular directory structure that you are not free to change.
* Ant is imperative, while Maven is declarative.
   * Ant and Make both rely on the programmer to specify not just *what*, but *the exact steps* of what *in detail*.  
   * A target in an Ant `build.xml` does only what the programmer specifies; nothing more, nothing less.   
   * With Maven, you specify only *what* you want done, and some *configuration* for *how*, but the detailed steps are already programmed in behind the scenes. 
    
Some facts about XML:

* XML, like HTML uses open tags (e.g. `<foo>`) and close tags (`</foo>`)
* An open tag and close tag, with everything in between, is an element.
   * Example: This is one `foo` element.  The `foo` element contains two `bar` elements inside it.  
      ```xml
      <foo>
        <bar>content1</bar>
        <bar>content2</bar>
      </foo>
      ```
* Elements completely inside another element are children of that element. 
   * In this example, the `foo` element has two `bar` elements as children.
      ```xml
      <foo>
        <bar>content1</bar>
        <bar>content2</bar>
      </foo>
      ```      
* Open tags can have attributes, which are name value pairs.  Values should be in either single or double quotes:
   * In this example, the `pants` element has two attributes, with names `color` and `size` and values (respectively) `blue` and `medium`.   The `pocket` elements each have one attribute with name `type`.   The values of the `type` attributes, respectively, are `keys` and `phone`.
      ```xml
      <pants color="blue" size="medium">
        <pocket type="front">keys</pocket>
        <pocket type="side">phone</pocket>
      </pants>
      ```          
## Links to past exams

Note that the exact coverage of each of these exams varies quite a bit, since the pace of topics, and placement of exams during the quarter can vary considerably.  You are encouraged to look at all of them as examples of the types of questions you might be asked, but
match them against the topics we have covered, vs. the ones we have not covered.
