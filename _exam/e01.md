# Midterm Exam (80 minutes)

Link to actual exam (this is only a placeholder after after the exam is complete, graded,
and returned): [Actual Exam](cs56_m18_e01/){:data-ajax="false"}.

[Typos and clarifications](typos){:data-ajax="false"}


## Coverage

TBD, but for now:

**Homework:**

* [H00](/hwk/h00), [H01](/hwk/h01), [H02](/hwk/h02), [H03](/hwk/h03), [H04](/hwk/h04), [H05](/hwk/h05), [H06](/hwk/h06)
* Reading that was covered in those homework assignments
* [lab00](/lab/lab00), [lab01](/lab/lab01),[lab02](/lab/lab02),[lab03](/lab/lab03)
* Lectures through Wednesday 08/29/2018.

**A few selected topics:** (not an exclusive list, but some things from the homework, in-class work, reaading, labs, lectures, above that I may highlight:

* the distinction between primitive values, references, and the objects to which references refer
* == vs. .equals.  Review this web page: [topics/java_double_equals_vs_dot_equals/](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/java_double_equals_vs_dot_equals/)
* how compiling and executing with bytecodes and the Java Virtual Machine differs from compiling and executing when working with C/C++
* working with ArrayList<E> (as in [lab02](/lab/lab02))
     * the distinction between implementing a class that inherits from `ArrayList<E>` (is-a) vs. one that has a private data member of type `ArrayList<E>` (has-a).    With is-a, you work with the `this` object.  With has-as, there is a data member you work with.  Understand what that means in terms of code.


## Links to past exams

Note that the exact coverage of each of these exams varies quite a bit, since the pace of topics, and placement of exams during the quarter can vary considerably.  You are encouraged to look at all of them as examples of the types of questions you might be asked, but
match them against the topics we have covered, vs. the ones we have not covered.
