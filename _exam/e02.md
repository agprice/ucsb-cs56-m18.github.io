# Final Exam (80 minutes) (9:30-10:50am)

Link to actual exam (this is only a placeholder after after the exam is complete, graded,
and returned): [Actual Exam](cs56_m18_e02/){:data-ajax="false"}.

## Coverage

Same as [Midterm 1](/exam/e01) plus:
* Design Patterns (H07,H08,H09,H10)
* Web apps (be able to write about your technical and non-technical learnings)
   * I will not be asking questions about specific technologies (e.g. Sparkjava, GET vs. POST, Bootstrap, Mustache, etc.)
   * The reason is that each of you may have worked on different part of the app.
   * I *will* however expect you to be able to describe *your* technical contribution to the app, using
      *correct* technical terms and information.  
   * So while you do not need to know everything technical about your webapp, you do need to know *something* technical about your webapp, and be prepared to write about it.
   * You should also be prepared to write about the non-technical aspects of building your app (defining the user story, working together as a team, splitting up the work, bringing parts back together,etc.)
   
   
      
    
## Links to past exams

Note that the exact coverage of each of these exams varies quite a bit, since the pace of topics, and placement of exams during the quarter can vary considerably.  You are encouraged to look at all of them as examples of the types of questions you might be asked, but
match them against the topics we have covered, vs. the ones we have not covered.
