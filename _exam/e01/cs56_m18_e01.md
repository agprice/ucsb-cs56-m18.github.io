<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> For this question, you need page 1 of 
[handout A](handout_a/) with code for these files: `Beverage.java`, `Edible.java`,
`Food.java`, `FreeCandy.java` and `Product.java`.   These are classes used by a 
grocery store known as "Trader Bobs".

Some of these methods will compile and run, while others will not.

Indicate, for each method, whether it compiles or not, and if it does compile, the output when invoked.

<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> (10 pts) For this
question, and all the remaining ones on this exam, you should refer to page 2 of 
[handout B](handout_b/) which shows a short program called
`AllFactors.java`, along with it's output.  As you can see, this
program outputs a list of the prime factors of the integers from 1 to
50.

You should also refer to page 2 of [handout A](handout_a/) which
shows the `Factors` class; this class is used by the `AllFactors`
class.  To help you understand what the methods of the `Factor` class
are supposed to do, [handout B](handout_b/) also has some code for
JUnit tests for these classes, along with some explanatory comments.
You may assume that all of the test cases pass; this has been
verified.

* Please note that NOT ALL OF THE CODE for the `Factors` is shown.
* Missing code is indicated with with blanks (<tt>_________</tt>).

Similar to the `Polynomial` class from lab02, the class `Factors` extends  `java.util.ArrayList`.
A reference for `ArrayList` appears on page 1 of [handout B](handout_b/).

In this problem, you'll be asked to fill in some of the missing code for this class.
Please read the instructions carefully, and also read ALL of the code and test cases before
asking any questions.  The answers lie in the code.

The constructor for `Factors` takes a plain old Java `int []` as a parameter,
and puts all of the elements into the `ArrayList<Integer>` for the Factors object.

This method is incomplete.  You might not use all of the blanks! (that is, the correct
answer might leave some of them unused.)  Since answers and approaches may vary, if you need
to write more lines of code, fit them in as needed; the intended answer uses no more blanks
than the ones provided.

```java


    public Factors(int [] nums) {
    

       ___________________________________________

       for (int i: nums) {

             ______________________________________

	}

       ___________________________________________
    }





```

<li markdown="1" > (10 pts)  Refer to the previous problem for
an explanation of the context of this code.   Fill in the missing line.

It can be solved with one line but there are multiple possible approaches.
If your solution requires two or three lines, fill in those
lines above and below the blank as needed.



```java
    /**  add factor to end of list  */
    public void addFactor(int f) {



        ________________________________________

    }
```

	  for (int i=2; i<=lastElement/2; i++) {
	    if (lastElement % i == 0) {
	     	this.replaceLastFactor(i);
		    this.addFactor(lastElement/i);
		    return;
	    }
	  }
    }

```

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 20em;">(10 pts) Note that there is no code for an overridden `toString` method for the `Factors` class.  And yet the sample output does not show this, like we might expect for a class with no overridden toString in the source code.

```
i: 1 factors: Factors@ab341245
i: 2 factors: Factors@ab3094fc
i: 3 factors: Factors@ab34d284
i: 4 factors: Factors@ab3410fe
i: 5 factors: Factors@ab3fca51
... etc.
```

Explain why we get the output that we do, i.e.

```
i: 1 factors: [1]
i: 2 factors: [2]
i: 3 factors: [3]
i: 4 factors: [2, 2]
i: 5 factors: [5]
... etc.
```

<li style="margin-bottom:25em;" >(10 pts) Explain the role of "targets" in an ant `build.xml` file.  Include only enough detail that at a job interview, the interveiwer would be confident that you know what you are talking about.
