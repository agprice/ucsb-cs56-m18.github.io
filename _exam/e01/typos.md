## Hints/Clarifications:

* For the `Factors.java` file: the pre- and post- conditions above `addNextFactor`  
   apply *only* to the method `addNextFactor`, not to any other
   method or constructor.  
    * NEW: That means, you don't need to worry about order in the constructor.
        Just take the elements in the order they come.  
* If the notation `for (int i: nums)` is unfamiliar; it was covered in the chapter. Do 
    your best to infer what it means, and answer on that basis.
* For number 7, the blank should simply be filled with an expression that 
   correctly initializes the variable `lastElement`.
* `remove` in java.util.ArrayList "Removes the element at the specified position in this list. Shifts any subsequent elements to the left (subtracts one from their indices)."  (But I don't think you need this.)
## Notices

* IGNORE SEAT NUMBER.  Leave it blank.
* YOU MAY RIP OFF HANDOUTS
* You may use **one sheet of notes** as usual.  Please write your name on it
* **No talking** during the exam.  Please put all questions in writing on the green sheet.
