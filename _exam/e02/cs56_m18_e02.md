<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before"> For this question, you need page 1 of 
[handout A](handout_a/) with code for these files: `Beverage.java`, `Edible.java`,
`Food.java`, `FreeCandy.java` and `Product.java`.   These are classes used by a 
grocery store known as "Trader Bobs".

Some of these methods will compile and run, while others will not.

Indicate, for each method, whether it compiles or not, and if it does compile, the output when invoked.
in context of the classes on [handout A](handout_a/) and assuming the methods appear inside this class:

```java
public class TraderBobs {
 // methods appear here

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:1em;"> Answer each of the following questions as if you were in a job interview.   Your interviewer has a short attention span, and if you don't get to the point quickly and clearly, you'll lose the chance for the job.  So make the answers short, but not *too* short.

The space shown gives you an idea of the maximum length answer I'm looking for.  Your answer should *easily* fit into the space given.

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:10em;">(10 pts) It is said that design patterns are "discovered, not invented".  What does this mean?
</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:20em;">(10 pts) Choose one of the following design patterns, and explain where it is useful, but with an application DIFFERENT from one the one in the Head First Design Patterns textbook.

That is, choose ONE (and only one of these), and answer it:
* Explain Strategy without talking about Ducks (or flying or quacking)
* Explain Observer without taking about a Weather Station
* Explain Decorator without talking about Coffee (or any Beverages, Condiments or food products).

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:1em;">All classes in Java inherit certain methods from `java.lang.Object`.  There are at least three such methods that are standard "good practice" to override.

Write a short but complete Java class definition for a class Vehicle that has private attribute `licensePlate` of type `String` and `capacity` of type `int` (i.e. capacity is the number of passengers that can ride in the vehicle.

For full credit, include:
* (4 pts) A constructor that takes `licensePlate` and `capacity` as parameters
* (6 pts) Getters for the two attributes (setters are not needed)
* (15 pts) Definitions of three methods that, according to common good Java practice, should be overridden, instead of relying on the default implementation inherited from `java.lang.Object`.  (For full credit, include the Java annotation that should be used when overriding a method.)

<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:1em;">In this question, please focus on your web application project.

Please write clearly; your answer will be graded on clarity as well as
content.  Minor grammar/spelling errors will not cause deductions, as
long as the meaning is clear&mdash;errors that make the meaning
difficult to understand will result in deductions.

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 10em;">(8 pts) Every application should meet some need that the user has, or help them acheive some goal.  What is the name of your app,, and what is the goal, or need that a user of your app can get met by using your app?

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 20em;">(10 pts) How did you, personally, make a technical contribution to your team's success?

Be specific about your technical contributions.  Describe a technical challenge that your team faced in enough detail that it is clear you understood the challenge.  Mention enough specifics of either Java code, Maven, Git/Github, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, database technology, Mustache or something else, so that the grader can know that you understand the issues involved.  Then describe how you helped to contribute to solving the problem.   Be brief, but include "just enough detail" to make it clear that you know what you are talking about.

</li>

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom: 20em;">(10 pts) There are also many non-technical challenges that can arise when trying to work with a team of 4-6 people to build a project.   Describe a *specfic* non-technical challenge (communication, scheduling, coordination, etc.) that arose during your project, and how you overcame it.
